# Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter

A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a hardware feature 
that handles communication (i.e., timing requirements and data framing) using
widely-adopted asynchronous serial communication interfaces, such as RS232, 
RS422, and RS485. 
A UART provides a widely adopted and cheap method to realize full-duplex or
half-duplex data exchange among different devices.
