# FreeRTOS Tasks

A real time application that uses an RTOS can be structured as a **set of independent tasks**. 

Each task **executes within its own context** with no coincidental dependency on other tasks 
within the system or the RTOS scheduler itself. 

Only one task within the application can be executing at any point in time and the real time 
**RTOS scheduler** is responsible for deciding which task this should be. 
The RTOS scheduler may therefore repeatedly start and stop each task (swap each task in and 
out) as the application executes. As a task has no knowledge of the RTOS scheduler activity 
it is the responsibility of the real time RTOS scheduler to ensure that the processor context
(register values, stack contents, etc) when a task is swapped in is exactly that as when the 
same task was swapped out. To achieve this **each task is provided with its own stack**. 
When the task is swapped out the execution context is saved to the stack of that task so 
it can also be exactly restored when the same task is later swapped back in.


## Task States

A task can exist in one of the following states:

![Task States](../doc/tskstate.gif)

* **Running**: When a task is actually executing it is said to be in the Running state. 
    It is currently utilising the processor. If the processor on which the RTOS is 
    running only has a single core then there can only be one task in the Running 
    state at any given time.

* **Ready**: Ready tasks are those that are able to execute (they are not in the 
    Blocked or Suspended state) but are not currently executing because a different 
    task of equal or higher priority is already in the Running state.

* **Blocked**:
    A task is said to be in the Blocked state if it is currently waiting for either 
    a temporal or external event. For example, if a task calls vTaskDelay() it will 
    block (be placed into the Blocked state) until the delay period has expired - 
    a temporal event. Tasks can also block to wait for queue, semaphore, event group,
    notification or semaphore event. 
    
    Tasks in the Blocked state normally have a 'timeout' period, after which the task 
    will be timeout, and be unblocked, even if the event the task was waiting for has 
    not occurred.

    Tasks in the Blocked state do not use any processing time and cannot be selected 
    to enter the Running state.

* **Suspended**: Like tasks that are in the Blocked state, tasks in the Suspended 
    state cannot be selected to enter the Running state, but **tasks in the Suspended 
    state do not have a time out**. Instead, tasks only enter or exit the Suspended 
    state when explicitly commanded to do so through the vTaskSuspend() and xTaskResume() 
    API calls respectively.
